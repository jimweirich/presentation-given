Better Testing with Given/When/Then
-----------------------------------

Do you struggle with writing good tests? Do you want your executable specs to read like real specifications and not just code you have to wade through to understand?

Given/When/Then is an extension library for RSpec designed to take RSpec's excellent DSL for defining English-like specifications and taking it to the next level. Given/When/Then allows developers to clearly state what behaviors are being specified, what are the preconditions for that behavior, and what outcomes are expected under various scenarios.

This talk will cover not only the basics of Given/When/Then, but also best practices for writing readable and robust specifications that are not brittle when faced with code refactoring.
